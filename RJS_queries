How to avoid the need for binding in React?
		In ReactJs, when we're working with class-based components and want to access this inside a class method.
		This will need to bind it. Binding this allows it to access the state and setstate inside the class.
		To avoid the need for binding we have something introduced in ES6 as arrow functions.
		Using the arrow function to call this.setState will lead to avoid the use of bind.
		When we use the arrow function it works because of the of following reasons:
			It does not re-scope this, so we don’t need to bind this in the class constructor.
			JavaScript has first-class functions, which means functions are considered as data.
			Therefore, arrow functions can be assigned to class properties.
